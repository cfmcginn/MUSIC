Created personal fork off MUSIC:

git clone https://github.com/cfmcginn/MUSIC
cd MUSIC
git checkout -b MUSICForCustomZeta 0a29ff0e779bbaf75e5ec9da73bc7c5fbd54ebb6

Go in, build to confirm it works w/

cmake $PWD
make -j10

Successful build w/ src/mpihydro executable, run w/ our interface HydroStudy produces plausible physics output - Now mv this BRANCHLOG into repo + a README2 explaining the purpose of the fork + choice to build on old hash

First round of mods:
 * data.h
 * read_in_parameters.cpp
 * dissapative.h, .cpp

All touched for bulk viscosity being customizable from params file, initial customization as narrow (original in master + default here) and wide
